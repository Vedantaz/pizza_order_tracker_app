1. Error: No default engine was specified and no extension was provided.
soln : engine has to be set by app.set ("", engine name)
e.g -> app.set('views', express.static(__dirname + '/resources/views')); 
2 . mix.js is not a function ->
  soln :
    it may be due to advanced version of laravel.mix .
    Because in 5.0.4 version > it is working properly -> but at this time when current vesion of laravel.mix  = --version .. 6.0.43
    Not working and giving this error. 
    To do yarn watch  ->  yarn watch
    showing ->    We will use "yarn" to install the CLI via "yarn add -D webpack-cli".
                  Do you want to install 'webpack-cli' (yes/no): yes
    vry much time it took -> Result :
    : [webpack-cli] Error: Unknown option '--hide-modules'
    [webpack-cli] Run 'webpack --help' to see available commands and options
    error Command failed with exit code 2.

so final soln :  use updated tailwindcss , laravel-mix version and run npx mix .
                 Actually not run , you have to add some scripts in package.json ->
                 in place of production , development and watch. { is in the package.json }
                 # but although we install tailwind css package -> the css , scss ,js in a/c to path dpesn't 
                 means -> simply css we applied doesn't working.
                 that's why we have to add cdn link in home.ejs as a script.  
webpack.mix.js.
let mix = require('laravel-mix');

3. layout.js is not working ->
If you're using node, expess , mongoDB and in spite of react we are using laravel-mix-js so in there if you're layout.ejs file is not working  :
 soln :
  Routes are coming before / written before in code in main file from template engine code , 
  Template engine code should be come front and then routes code ... so that our layout.ejs will be run 
  IMP-NOTE : Just write : <%- body %> after the navbar code in layout and your files render perectly. 
4. Error: Cannot find module '../app/http/controller/cartController'
Require stack:
soln :
   a. this type generally comes when your path  | address is not given correctly i.e. 404 error .
# to get centered img,div else..
simple do it as mx-auto -> a @tailwind-css utility.
# To get the img rendering in your page : should not give 4040 image 
the soln :
 1. write correct path , 
 2. co-relate your path with the path you are in working 
 3. write code like : img src='/img/cart-img.png' ðŸ’¯ , wrong way : img src='/img/cart-img' ; it's a small thing but yaa , yaa shows 4040 error if extension we don't write.

 # flex-1 > jiitni bhi space sab space eauqal divide krte he sab elements

 # p-2 means 2px space from all sides..

 # node.js mein har ek file ek module hoti hain. -> isiliye hum isko export bhi kr sakte hain.

 # ./ -> meaning is simple : it locates current folder. 

 # agar hum javascript mein koi object pass krte hain > toh woh humnein mil jata hain by reference 
   i.e. ki globally available oobjects mein se.
